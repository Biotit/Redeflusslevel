# OpenStreetMap 
![osm](osm_icons/120px-Public-images-osm_logo.svg.png)[*OpenStreetMap*](https://www.openstreetmap.org) is a free and open-source database for spatial data competing with profit-oriented companies and can be edited by everybody. Therefore, it is for the best of the world, to improve *OpenStreetMap* whereever we can. Moreover, it is important for a free society to maintain free data sources and to provide knowledge without censorship, political or financial influence to everybody. 

## Castles in OpenStreetMap
Castles in *OpenStreetMap* can be tagged OpenStreetMap as nodes, ways or relations, spanning one or two dimensions, respectively. Every object in OpenStreetMap is tagged using *key=value*, defining its properties, e.g. how it is displayed on the map. For a lot of analyses it is helpful to destinguish between castles with major visible remains and the ones without (see my report for the course *Spatial Statistics and Visualization with R*.)


![castle](osm_icons/30px-Castle-14.svg.png)Castles that have **major visible remains** should be tagged using [*historic=castle*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:historic%3Dcastle). However, this includes post-medieval fortresses, stately homes, palaces, and pre-medieval roman castra. Hence, when using these data, it is important to filter the data to only contain castles built in the Middle Ages (about 500 to 1500 AD). As such, I can recomend including all objects with *historic=castle* that contained the string *Burg*, *Ruine*, or *Motte* within their name or linked Wikipedia article, unless they had a *castle_type* of *castrum*, *manor*, *fortress*, or *stately*.


![archsite](osm_icons/30px-Archaeological-site-16.svg.png)Castles that are **mostly or fully vanished**, i.e. that have few to no visible remains should be tagged using [*historic=archaeological_site*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:historic%3Darchaeological_site) and *archaeological_site=fortification*. However, this tag includes pre-medieval fortifications such as the roman limes or neolithic ring ditches, and post-medieval sconces. Therefore, I can recommend considering objects as castles that contained the string *Burg*, *Ruine*, or *Motte* within their name or linked Wikipedia article. However, they were excluded, if they contained a *fortification_type* of *castrum* or *sconce*.

Castles in ruins can also be tagged as [*historic=ruins*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:historic%3Druins) and *ruins=castle*. However, this leads to **uncertainty about their visible remains**, if no further tag exists. I can recommand considering all points with the tag ruins=castle as castles, after filtering them the same way as the visible castles. Further, there might be not clearly assignable castles including all objects containing the key *castle_type*, but not *historic=castle*. It might be useful considering them as castles if the contain the values *defensive*, *hillfort*, and *citadel*. Similar, of the key *fortification_type*, it makes sense to include the values *motte*, and *ringfort* as castles, even if the objects did not contain the *archaeological_site=fortification*. Additionally, objects containing the key *historic:civilization* with the values *medieval*, or *middle-ages*, and that contained the string *Schloss*, *Burg*, *Ruine*, or *Motte* within their name or linked Wikipedia article might be considered castles. Further, filtering these objects to only include medieval castle types, if *castle_type* is given, and excluding medieval *watermills*, *churches* and *moats* makes sense.
